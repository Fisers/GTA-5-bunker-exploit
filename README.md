# GTA-5-bunker-exploit
A simple CMD mod for the game I created with an latvian interface using [Onra2's source](https://github.com/onra2/Onra2-s-mini-external-cheat)

## Includes
- Bunker money exploit (sets delivered weapons to a much larger amount than possible)
- RP multiplier
- Level gaining exploit (applies and removes wanted level really fast)

Everything was updated to the latest addresses and simplified, removing unnecesary features.
